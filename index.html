						<p>It’s very difficult to decrease body fat and reach peak fitness at the same time. To lose fat, you need to eat fewer calories. This can make training feel more difficult and prevent you from performing at your best. For this reason, it’s best to lose fat in the off-season, when you’re not competing. If that’s not possible, aim for less intense training periods.</p>
						<p>If you cut calories too drastically, your nutrient intake may not support proper training and recovery. This can increase your risk of injury, illness, and overtraining syndrome. The latest sports nutrition guidelines also warn against eating too few calories and reaching a dangerously low body fat percentage, both of which can disrupt reproductive function and diminish bone health</p>
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						<p>If you’re looking to burn some serious fat and you’re not afraid of a little intensity, you’ve come to the right program. Super Shredded 8 (“SS8” for short) is an 8-week get-lean plan based mainly on supersets – but it’s so much more than that. If I had to sum up what Super Shredded 8 is, I would say it's a combination of my Show Time, 1-2-3 Lean and Un-Rested Development programs. That’s quite a hybrid, huh?</p>
						<p>My Super-Man program uses supersets in which exercises for opposing muscle groups are paired together. With SS8, the supersets pair exercises for the same muscle group. This is technically called a “compound set,” a term coined by the late Joe Weider over 50 years ago. But nowadays, the lifting community basically calls any pairing of two exercises with no rest in between a superset, so I’ll stick with the more modern verbiage.  </p>
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						<p>Everyone knows that exercise is one of the best things you can do for your health. But most people ignore one crucial component of it: resistance training. According to federal researchers, only 6 percent of adults do the recommended minimum amount of at least two muscle-strengthening workouts each week. Neglecting resistance training – any type of workout that builds strength and muscle – is a big mistake.</p>
						<p>It increases your metabolism, lowers your body fat and protects you from some of the leading causes of early death and disability. You don’t have to lift like a bodybuilder (or look like one) to benefit from resistance training. And it’s never too late to get started. Here is everything you need to know about resistance training, along with some simple, expert-approved workouts you can do at the gym or at home with minimal equipment.</p>
